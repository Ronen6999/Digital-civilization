## Key Events
Economy resources changed significantly: 3.8521
- Economy tradeVolume changed significantly: 11.8669
- Population count changed significantly: -63243.0000
- Technology researchInvestmentChange changed significantly: 5.8837

## AI Analysis
Civilization system (world):
- Economy grows slowly at 0.4%, with trade and resources rising a little.
- People number 549,638, with low happiness at 26% but tech strength remains high.
- Stability sits at 60%, with moderate resistance and steady legitimacy.
- Compared to last cycle: happiness improved but population fell sharply.
- Entropy stays low, keeping daily life mostly steady.
Civilization summary: World holds together but feels strained and uneven.
Machine system:
- Machine is ready but held back by a small budget.
- Machine not activated because budget 10 is below the 20 needed to act.
- It watches employment, happiness, and health since those thresholds are already met.
- Machine activation: employment threshold reached, so actions could start if funds allowed.
Machine summary: Machine stands by, limited by cost despite meeting key triggers.

## Overview

This project is a **math + probability driven simulation** of a digital civilization. Each cycle updates world-state variables (economy, population, technology, stability, entropy, resistance, legitimacy) using **bounded equations**, **weighted averages**, and **random noise**. The “machine system” is a rule-based controller that can intervene when thresholds are hit.

**Important:** No AI model is used to run the simulation itself. AI is only used to **summarize already-generated logs** into short markdown reports.

## How the simulation works

### State and cycles
- **State**: stored in `data/world.json` and `data/machine.json`
- **Cycle logs**: every cycle produces:
  - `data/cycles/raw/cycle-XXXX.json` (full raw snapshot + deltas)
  - `data/cycles/summaries/cycle-XXXX.md` (human-readable summary)
- **Cycle counter**: `data/evolution_count.json` tracks how many cycle summaries have been generated (next cycle index).
- **Default run behavior**: `node src/index.js` runs **1 cycle per execution**, continuing from the last cycle (up to 10,000 total).

### Core math patterns (used across systems)
- **Noise / uncertainty**: most updates add uniform noise via `Random.range(min, max)`
- **Clamping**: many variables are bounded with `MathUtils.clamp(x, min, max)` (common for \(0 \ldots 1\) signals)
- **Smoothing / inertia**: many updates blend old and new values, e.g. \(x_{t+1} = 0.9x_t + 0.1\Delta\)

### World systems (examples of the actual equations)
These are simplified descriptions of what the code does in `src/world/*.js`.

- **Economy** (`src/world/economySystem.js`)
  - Resources compound with growth:
    - \(resources_{t+1} = resources_t \cdot (1 + growthRate_{t+1})\)
  - Trade reacts to confidence and noise:
    - \(trade_{t+1} = trade_t \cdot (0.95 + 0.1\cdot confidence) + U(-50, 50)\)
  - Inflation, employment, confidence update via weighted factors + noise, then clamp to ranges.

- **Population** (`src/world/populationSystem.js`)
  - Net growth mixes baseline + effects of happiness/health/education + noise:
    - \(netGrowth = base + 0.2(happiness-0.5) + 0.1(health-0.5) + 0.05(education-0.5) + U(-0.005, 0.005)\)
  - Count updates multiplicatively:
    - \(count_{t+1} = \max(1000,\ \text{round}(count_t \cdot (1 + netGrowth)))\)
  - Happiness is a smoothed weighted blend of economy/health/education/urbanization + noise, clamped to \(0..1\).

- **Stability** (`src/world/stabilitySystem.js`)
  - Political/social/economic sub-stabilities update with inertia + weighted drivers + noise.
  - Overall stability is a weighted average:
    - \(overall = 0.3\cdot political + 0.25\cdot social + 0.25\cdot economic + 0.2\cdot cohesion\)

- **Technology** (`src/world/technologySystem.js`)
  - Tech level grows based on innovation and adoption:
    - \(level_{t+1} = level_t \cdot (1 + innovationBoost \cdot adoptionFactor)\)
  - Breakthrough probability is computed from innovation rate and research investment (bounded to a sensible range).

- **Entropy** (`src/world/entropySystem.js`)
  - Entropy is a net balance of “sources” minus “sinks” with random perturbations:
    - \(current_{t+1} = clamp(current_t + production - reduction,\ 0.01,\ max)\)
  - Higher entropy reduces predictability and increases disorder/chaos potential.

### Causal effects graph (system-to-system coupling)
After each system updates independently, the simulation applies a **causal graph** (`src/world/worldModelGraph.js`) that propagates changes using weighted relationships, for example:
- economy.resources → population.growthRate (weight 0.4)
- population.happiness → stability.social (weight 0.5)
- entropy.current → stability.overall (weight -0.4)

This creates feedback loops and cross-system effects without hard-coding every interaction into every system.

### Thresholds and “events”
The causal graph also defines thresholds that flag dangerous regimes (e.g., low stability or runaway entropy). These are recorded in logs as “threshold violations”.

## Machine system (rule-based, not an AI model)
The machine system (`src/machine/*`) is a **deterministic + stochastic controller** that maintains internal state (beliefs, emotions, predictions, introspection) and may produce **interventions** when thresholds are hit.

- **Perception**: transforms the world into a machine-perceived state with relevance/noise filters (`src/core/perceptionLayer.js`).
- **Interventions**: generated from simple rules + priorities + a budget constraint (`src/machine/interventionEngine.js`).
  - Interventions only occur if priority exceeds a threshold and the machine has enough budget.
- **Legitimacy constraints**: world legitimacy can scale down intervention strength (`src/world/legitimacySystem.js` + `src/core/simulationRunner.js`).

## Where AI is used (summaries only)
AI is **not used** to compute economy/population/stability/etc. The only AI call is in the logger to turn cycle logs into a short human-readable narrative:
- `src/logging/summaryGenerator.js` calls an external API to produce the markdown text under `## AI Analysis`.
  - If you remove/disable that call, the simulation still runs and logs raw data normally.
