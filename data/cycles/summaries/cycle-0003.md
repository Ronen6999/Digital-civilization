Civilization summary: A strained but functioning world with small gains and steady pressure.
Machine system:
- Machine not activated because the budget is too low for any action.
- It monitors employment, happiness, and health, all already at their trigger points.
- It stays ready, watching conditions but unable to act due to cost limits.
- Machine activation: employment is already at threshold, so actions could start if funds allowed.
Machine summary: Ready system held back by limited budget and unmet cost needs.
